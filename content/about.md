Hi, I'm Léonard.  
I am a SRE/Platform engineer, currently working at [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai).
Learning and experimenting with cloud native technologies is a passion of mine. I'm particularly interested in bare-metal management for k8s clusters.
You can find me in a small town in Brittany, France.
